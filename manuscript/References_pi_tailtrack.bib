               organisms in modern neuroscience. In addition to their low
               maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one
               key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of
               animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of
               select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools.
               However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types
               of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well
               as a controlled behavioural arena, can be costly. Here, we
               present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called
               'FlyPi'. Our design is based on a 3D-printed mainframe, a
               Raspberry Pi computer, and high-definition camera system as well
               as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending
               on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under €100
               and features optional modules for light-emitting diode
               (LED)-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation
               as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for
               thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs
               approximately €200 or substantially less if the user is prepared
               to 'shop around'. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled
               through a custom-written graphical user interface. To
               demonstrate FlyPi's capabilities, we present its use in a series
               of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we
               demonstrate FlyPi's utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well
               as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several
               African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular

                 Research is made reproducible by documenting all data and task
                 design parameters in a human-readable and publishable format

  abstract  = "Tools enabling closed-loop experiments are crucial to delineate
               causal relationships between the activity of genetically labeled
               neurons and specific behaviors. We developed the Raspberry Pi
               Virtual Reality (PiVR) system to conduct closed-loop optogenetic
               stimulation of neural functions in unrestrained animals. PiVR is
               an experimental platform that operates at high temporal
               resolution (70 Hz) with low latencies (<30 milliseconds), while
               being affordable (<US\$500) and easy to build (<6 hours).
               Through extensive documentation, this tool was designed to be
               accessible to a wide public, from high school students to
               professional researchers studying systems neuroscience. We
               illustrate the functionality of PiVR by focusing on sensory
               navigation in response to gradients of chemicals (chemotaxis)
               and light (phototaxis). We show how Drosophila adult flies
               perform negative chemotaxis by modulating their locomotor speed
               to avoid locations associated with optogenetically evoked bitter
               taste. In Drosophila larvae, we use innate positive chemotaxis
               to compare behavior elicited by real- and virtual-odor
               gradients. Finally, we examine how positive phototaxis emerges
               in zebrafish larvae from the modulation of turning maneuvers to
               orient in virtual white-light gradients. Besides its application
               to study chemotaxis and phototaxis, PiVR is a versatile tool

               affecting pigment cell fate in the zebrafish neural crest.
               Homozygous nacre (nac(w2)) mutants lack melanophores throughout
               development but have increased numbers of iridophores. The
               non-crest-derived retinal pigment epithelium is normal,
               suggesting that the mutation does not affect pigment synthesis
               per se. Expression of early melanoblast markers is absent in
               nacre mutants and transplant experiments suggested a
               cell-autonomous function in melanophores. We show that nac(w2)
               is a mutation in a zebrafish gene encoding a basic
               helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor related to
               microphthalmia (Mitf), a gene known to be required for
               development of eye and crest pigment cells in the mouse.
               Transient expression of the wild-type nacre gene restored
               melanophore development in nacre(-/-) embryos. Furthermore,
               misexpression of nacre induced the formation of ectopic
               melanized cells and caused defects in eye development in
               wild-type and mutant embryos. These results demonstrate that
               melanophore development in fish and mammals shares a dependence
               on the nacre/Mitf transcription factor, but that proper
               development of the retinal pigment epithelium in the fish is not
               nacre-dependent, suggesting an evolutionary divergence in the

              but inconsequential stimuli. Despite being the most basic form of
              learning, a consensus model on the underlying mechanisms has yet
              to emerge. To probe relevant mechanisms we took advantage of a
              visual habituation paradigm in larval zebrafish, where larvae
              reduce their reactions to abrupt global dimming (a dark flash).
              We used Ca2+imaging during repeated dark flashes and identified
              12 functional classes of neurons that differ based on their rate
              of adaptation, stimulus response shape, and anatomical location.
              While most classes of neurons depressed their responses to
              repeated stimuli, we identified populations that did not adapt,
              or that potentiated their response. These neurons were
              distributed across brain areas, consistent with a distributed
              learning process. Using a small molecule-screening approach, we
              confirmed that habituation manifests from multiple distinct
              molecular mechanisms, and we have implicated molecular pathways
              in habituation, including: Melatonin, Estrogen and GABA
              signaling. However, by combining anatomical analyses and
              pharmacological manipulations with Ca2+imaging, we failed to
              identify a simple relationship between pharmacology, altered
              activity patterns, and habituation behaviour. Collectively, our
              work indicates that habituation occurs via a complex and
              distributed plasticity processes that cannot be captured by a
              simple model. Therefore, untangling the mechanisms of habituation
              will likely require dedicated approaches aimed at sub-component
              mechanisms underlying this multidimensional learning process.",

              and prey capture",
  author   = "Budick, S A and O'Malley, D M",
  abstract = "Larval zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) are a popular model system
              because of their genetic attributes, transparency and relative
              simplicity. They have approximately 200 neurons that project from
              the brainstem into the spinal cord. Many of these neurons can be
              individually identified and laser-ablated in intact larvae. This
              should facilitate cellular-level characterization of the
              descending control of larval behavior patterns. Towards this end,
              we attempt to describe the range of locomotor behavior patterns
              exhibited by zebrafish larvae. Using high-speed digital imaging,
              a variety of swimming and turning behaviors were analyzed in 6-
              to 9-day-old larval fish. Swimming episodes appeared to fall into
              two categories, with the point of maximal bending of the larva's
              body occurring either near the mid-body (burst swims) or closer
              to the tail (slow swims). Burst swims also involved
              larger-amplitude bending, faster speeds and greater yaw than slow
              swims. Turning behaviors clearly fell into two distinct
              categories: fast, large-angle escape turns characteristic of
              escape responses, and much slower routine turns lacking the large
              counterbend that often accompanies escape turns. Prey-capture
              behaviors were also recorded. They were made up of simpler
              locomotor components that appeared to be similar to routine turns
              and slow swims. The different behaviors observed were analyzed
              with regard to possible underlying neural control systems. Our
              analysis suggests the existence of discrete sets of controlling

               tail and eye motion in both freely-swimming and head-restrained

               code version in standardized formats to allow full provenance
               tracking, from data acquisition through analysis to publication.
               The package is modular and expandable for different experimental
               protocols and setups. Current releases can be found at
               https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra. We also provide complete

  abstract  = "Habituation is a simple form of learning where animals learn to
               reduce their responses to repeated innocuous stimuli [1].
               Habituation is thought to occur via at least two temporally and
               molecularly distinct mechanisms, which lead to short-term
               memories that last for seconds to minutes and long-term memories
               that last for hours or longer [1, 2]. Here, we focus on
               long-term habituation, which, due to the extended time course,
               necessitates stable alterations to circuit properties [2-4]. In
               its simplest form, long-term habituation could result from a
               plasticity event at a single point in a circuit, and many
               studies have focused on identifying the site and underlying
               mechanism of plasticity [5-10]. However, it is possible that
               these individual sites are only one of many points in the
               circuit where plasticity is occurring. Indeed, studies of
               short-term habituation in C. elegans indicate that in this
               paradigm, multiple genetically separable mechanisms operate to
               adapt specific aspects of behavior [11-13]. Here, we use a
               visual assay in which larval zebrafish habituate their response
               to sudden reductions in illumination (dark flashes) [14, 15].
               Through behavioral analyses, we find that multiple components of
               the dark-flash response habituate independently of one another
               using different molecular mechanisms. This is consistent with a
               modular model in which habituation originates from multiple
               independent processes, each adapting specific components of
               behavior. This may allow animals to more specifically or
               flexibly habituate based on stimulus context or internal states.",

               We mapped the structure of larval zebrafish swim trajectories in
